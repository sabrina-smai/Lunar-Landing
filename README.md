# Lunar-Landing
“simulate” the passage of time through using velocity, altitude, and fuel

Lunar Lander​ is one of the earliest computer games. With a proper choice of initial values, it is  fairly interesting to play, even though it is a text-only program.    

You will take the role of an astronaut in the lunar module attempting to land on the moon’s  surface. Gravity pulls you towards the moon at an increasing rate of speed. In order to land  safely, you must burn ​fuel​ to counter gravity’s acceleration to land on the moon at a safe speed  (below 10 m/s). However, be careful, you can only use so much ​fuel​. And if you are too high  when you run out of ​fuel​, you’ll inevitably crash at an unsafe speed.
